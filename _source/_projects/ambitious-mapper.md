## O, when will by edits appear on the map?

This swag design for OpenStreetMap US draws on a timeless question from new mappers and longtime mappers alike: how long must I wait to see the results of my efforts? Thankfully, few mappers have gone to greater lengths to redraw the map than Napoleon.

This boxy, oversize tee fits a modern streetwear aesthetic, suitable for everything from house parties to beach picnics to marching across Europe.

## It's just so Richmond

In 2023 I was lucky enough to lead the logo design for the best party in mapping: State of the Map US. The result, in the words of one RVA local, is "just so Richmond".

In a departure from most prior State of the Map US logos, the conference team opted for a monochrome design. The intent was to have something versatile that operated well in different contexts and different colors, and would look sleak on a shirt without using as much plastic ink.

Richmond is one of the most-tattooed cities in the US, so we decided to draw inspiration from classic tattoo art with an incised blackletter font. The raven nods to the [classic work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raven) of onetime Richmond resident Edgar Allen Poe and adds to the gothic feel.

The logo is framed by the iconic [A-Line Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSX_A-Line_Bridge) and its reflection in the James River. Dogwoods, the state flower of Virginia, give a springtime flourish.

And of course our logo wouldn't be complete without a map element, so we have the outline of Virginia (including the Eastern Shore!) with the capital star over Richmond.

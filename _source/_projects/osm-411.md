If you've spent much time in the OpenStreetMap community you'll know that there are loads of amazing tools for exploring the map. Advanced users will often open the same data in multiple tools, depending on which is better suited to a specific task.

[OSM 411](https://osm411.org) is a website that makes it easy to browse different OSM tools while maintaining context. Basically it's a big list of links that will all open to the same location. Users can customize the settings and then create a single link to save or share, while developers can configure the page with URL parameters.

I invite you to [try it out](https://osm411.org/#map=14/39.9524/-75.1636) or [learn more on GitHub](https://github.com/waysidemapping/osm-411).

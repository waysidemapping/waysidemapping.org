## Twitch plays OpenStreetMap

So you could spend months reading the OSM Wiki trying to figure out how to map somethingâ€”or you could just learn by watching.

With the Wayside Mapping channels on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/WaysideMapping) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WaysideMapping), I provide mapping livestreams and videos intended to demo the intricacies of OpenStreetMap editing. I always felt OSM was a little like a video game, so why not stream it like one? Come join the chat and let me know what you want to see mapped ðŸ¤™

## Welcome to Virginia

"[Virginia Is For Lovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Is_for_Lovers)", one of the more famous tourism slogans, can be found on welcome signs all over the state. Ahead of State of the Map US 2023 in Richmond, I adapted the design for the love of mappers, taking special care to place the ❤️ at the approximate location of RVA.

A sticker with this graphic was a freebie for conference attendees.

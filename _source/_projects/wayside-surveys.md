## The wayside beckons

When not at my desk, I spend as much time as I can taking the scenic route to the next spot on the map. How you get somewhere can be just as important as where you're going, if not more so.

I desired to preserve a piece of the places I passed through, some of them rather fragile to change, so I tried mounting a GoPro to the hood and pressing record. The resulting videos became [Wayside Surveys](https://www.youtube.com/@waysidesurveys) (formerly Wayside Geographic).

Now expanded to train trips, boat trips, and more, the channel is a high-resolution record of special places at specific points in time, documented for the benefit of mappers and future generations alike.

## Sample video

This relatively short drive in rural Arizona gives a taste for the channel (my [longest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ThFsHcf1ZA) is over six hours.) I recommend pumping the video quality up as high as you can to avoid compression artifacts.

## Join the ultimate (virtual) winter road trip

Following up on my [Beach Camping](/projects/musa-camping-logo/) logo for Mapping USA 2022 & 2024, I wanted to whip up something new for 2025 that still felt consistent with the graphic history of this virtual conference series. I took a new look at Holly Moore's delightful [surfboard camperbus logo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mapping_USA_2021_logo.svg) from MUSA 2021 and decided to give it an update.

Since this event would be in January, the laws of nature require we switch from beach bum to ski bum. We've traded in our VW bus for an Airstream trailer, our surfboards and ocean teals for snowboards and icy blues. Someone even drew "2025" on the frosty back windshield. Of course we have to register our rig in California, the rare place you can enjoy the beach and the slopes in the same day.

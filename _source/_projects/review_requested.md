## i would like someone to review my edits

As part of re-launching the OpenStreetMap US swag store, I created a design referencing the checkbox that OSM mappers see when uploading a changeset in iD or JOSM. Selecting this option  adds a [`review_requested=yes`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:review_requested) tag to the changeset, hence the name of the product series.

This graphic was intended primarily for baby onesies and toddler shirts, a rarity for tech-themed merchandise. By popular demand, the design was expanded to adult-sized t-shirts and other items.

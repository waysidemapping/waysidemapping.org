[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about/) (OSM) is the world's largest collaborative mapping project, a critical data source for thousands of apps used by millions of people every day. But to newcomers, and even to geospatial professionals, the peculiar world of OSM can be challenging to approach.

The OpenStreetMap Hotline, a free service of Wayside Mapping, provides the customer support email address missing from openstreetmap.org. OSM is complicated and the documentation can feel overwhelming. If you just need to ask an OSM expert a few questions, you've come to the right place.

Hi, I'm Quincy Morgan (username [quincylvania](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/quincylvania)), an open source mapper and developer. I've contributed over 10,000 changesets to OSM since 2016 and have worked building software for both the OpenStreetMap Foundation and OpenStreetMap US. I'm embedded in the OSM community and am a regular at open mapping conferences.

Suffice to say, if I can't answer your question then I can point you to someone who can :)

## How is this supported?

The OpenStreetMap Hotline is free to contact but not free to run. We rely on donations and paid contracts to keep the lights on. If this service has been useful to you or your organization, we humbly ask you to consider [leaving a tip](/give/) or [hiring us](/contact/).

## Terms of use

By contacting the OpenStreetMap Hotline you agree to the terms of use. Wayside Mapping provides no warranty, does not assume risk, does not give legal advice, and does not guarantee any level of service. All parties are expected to maintain courtesy and professionalism. This is a free volunteer service, please be patient and nice :)

## About Quincy
Hi, I'm Quincy Morgan, the proprietor of Wayside Mapping. Thanks for stopping in ðŸ¤™

I'm passionate about free and open map data and mapping software.

As a traveler, I have on-the-ground experience in a wide diversity of landscapes, particularly in North America. I've spent time in each of the contiguous 48 US states and all 10 provinces of Canada, criss-crossing the continent via backroads, interstates, ferries, and trains. You'll often find me hiking, cycling, or paddlingâ€”all the while collecting geodata.

Hey there, I'm Quincy Morgan: freelance OpenStreetMap expert and geospatial developer. I'd [love to help](/#hire) with your data or software project. Check out [my portfolio](/#portfolio) for inspiration :)

<h1 id="about"><a href="{{siteurl}}{{baseurl}}/#about">About Me</a></h1>

Quincy Morgan (that's me!) is a New York-based open source software builder and certified map nerd. I've dedicated my career to the cause of free and open geographic knowledge.

## Career in OpenStreetMap

The world's largest collaborative map database, OpenStreetMap sits at the center of folk geography and the geospatial industry. Most of my career has been focused on this strange, amazing project relied on by millions of people every data.

From 2018 to 2021 I was a full-time maintainer of [iD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID_(software)), the default and most-used OpenStreetMap editor. During this time, I helped develop a number of core features including iPad support, multiselect editing, and issue detection. If you've ever visited [osm.org/edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id) then you've already interacted with my work.

I was Technical Lead at OpenStreetMap US from 2022 to 2025, where I supported the tech needs of the organization and its partners as we worked to grow OSM in the United States. My accomplishments included modernizing the Field Papers codebase, helping launch the Community Projects program, and rebuilding the OSM US website.

I remain committed to OpenStreetMap in a volunteer capacity through map edits, working group participation, and open source contributions.

## Travel experience

I believe the best way to gain geographic understanding of a place is to consider it firsthand. My travels have informed my work as a mapper, geospatial developer, and global citizen.

I'm lucky to have visited a wide diversity of landscapes. In North America alone I've experienced 48 US states, 29 US National Parks, 10 provinces of Canada, and 4,000 unique Amtrak route miles. 

While I'm now based in New York City, I grew up around Philadelphia and have lived in both northern and southern California. I've also spent extended time in southern Idaho, central Pennsylvania, and western Massachusetts.

When not at my desk you're likely to find me hiking, biking, paddling, train hopping, or road tripping to the next spot on the map.

If you're looking for an expert in OpenStreetMap data, tools, and community (and open geospatial in general), you've come to the right place.

I've mapped over 11,000 changesets in OSM since 2016 and am the only person to have been employed full-time by both the OpenStreetMap Foundation and [OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us/news/2022/06/welcome-quincy/). I've made major open source contributions to core OSM software projects such as iD and Field Papers, as well as to OSM Wiki documentation and OSM tagging standards. I'm embedded in the OSM community and am a regular at open mapping conferences.

_Some common tasks I can help you with:_

- Conflate and import a dataset into OpenStreetMap
- Map a specific place or feature type in OpenStreetMap
- Develop a pipeline for your organization to leverage open map data
- Add a feature to an open source geospatial tool, or adapt the tool to your use case
- Hold an instructional OpenStreetMap workshop (in-person or online)

Beyond OpenStreetMap, I provide services in full stack web development, GIS, UI/UX, graphic design, photography, and videography. I'm an frequent contributor to Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:quincy@waysidemapping.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quincy-morgan), or social media. I'd love to hear what you're working on!

<h1 id="sponsor"><a href="{{siteurl}}{{baseurl}}/#sponsor">Sponsor Me</a></h1>

Outside of paid contracts, I provide _pro bono_ work to many software and data projects within the open mapping ecosystem. Your financial support ensures I'm able to continue contributing to the mapping community as my full-time job.

You can sponsor me through [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/quincylvania) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/quincylvania). There are no fees on these sites.

**_Thank you for your support!!_**

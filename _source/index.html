Hi, I'm Quincy Morgan, the proprietor of Wayside Mapping. Thanks for stopping in ðŸ¤™

![](/img/quincy.jpg)

I'm passionate about free and open map data and mapping software.

As a traveler, I have on-the-ground experience in a wide diversity of landscapes, particularly in North America. I've spent time in each of the contiguous 48 US states and all 10 provinces of Canada, criss-crossing the continent via backroads, interstates, ferries, and trains. You'll often find me hiking, cycling, or paddlingâ€”all the while collecting geodata.

If you're looking for an expert in OpenStreetMap data, tools, and community (and open geospatial in general), you've come to the right place.

I've mapped over 11,000 changesets in OSM since 2016 and am the only person to have been employed full-time by both the OpenStreetMap Foundation and [OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us/news/2022/06/welcome-quincy/). I've made major open source contributions to core OSM software projects such as iD and Field Papers, as well as to OSM Wiki documentation and OSM tagging standards. I'm embedded in the OSM community and am a regular at open mapping conferences.

Beyond OpenStreetMap, I'm an avid contributor to Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons. I'm a graphic designer, photographer, and videographer, and can also provide general web design and development services.

My work is made possible via financial support from the community. Your tips ensure I'm able to continue contributing to the open mapping ecosystem as my full-time job.

I accept donations through [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/quincylvania) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/quincylvania). There are no fees on these sites. If you'd like to support me another way, or hire me for a contract, please [get in touch](/contact/).

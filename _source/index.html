Hey there, I'm Quincy Morgan, a freelance OpenStreetMap expert and geospatial developer. I'd [love to help](/#hire) with your data or software project. Check out [my portfolio](/#portfolio) for inspiration :)

<h1 id="about"><a href="{{siteurl}}{{baseurl}}/#about">About</a></h1>

Quincy Morgan (that's me!) is a New York-based open source software builder and certified map nerd. I'm passionate about free and open geographic knowledge.

I've dedicated most of my career to the world's largest collaborative map database, [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/about) (OSM). Sitting at the center of folk geography and the geospatial industry, this strange, amazing project is relied on by millions of people every data.

I was Technical Lead at [OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us) from 2022 to 2025, where I supported the tech needs of the organization and its partners as we worked to grow OSM in the United States. My accomplishments included building OpenTrailMap, modernizing the Field Papers codebase, helping launch the Community Projects program, and redesigning the org's website.

From 2018 to 2021 I was a full-time maintainer of [iD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID_(software)), the default and most-used OpenStreetMap editor. During this time, I helped develop a number of core features including iPad support, multiselect editing, and issue detection. If you've ever visited [osm.org/edit](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id) then you've already interacted with my work.

I remain committed to OpenStreetMap in a volunteer capacity through map edits, working group participation, and contributions to open source mapping tools.

When I'm not at my desk, you can find me hiking, biking, paddling, train hopping, or road tripping to the next spot on the map.

If you're looking for an expert in OpenStreetMap data, tools, and community, you've come to the right place.

Since 2016, I've edited more than one million OSM map features in 11,000 changesets. I'm the only person to have been employed full-time by both the OpenStreetMap Foundation and [OSM US](https://openstreetmap.us/news/2022/06/welcome-quincy/), having made major open source contributions to core software projects such as iD and Field Papers. I'm embedded in the OSM community and regularly give talks at open mapping conferences. 

_Some common tasks I can help you with:_

- Conflate and import a dataset into OpenStreetMap
- Map a specific place or feature type in OpenStreetMap
- Develop a pipeline for your organization to leverage open map data
- Add a feature to an open source geospatial tool, or adapt the tool to your use case
- Hold an instructional OpenStreetMap workshop (in-person or online)

Beyond OpenStreetMap, I provide services in full stack web development, GIS, UI/UX, graphic design, photography, and videography. I'm an frequent contributor to Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:quincy@waysidemapping.org), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quincy-morgan), or social media. I'd love to hear what you're working on!

Outside of paid contracts, I provide _pro bono_ work to many software and data projects within the open mapping ecosystem. Your financial support ensures I'm able to continue contributing to the mapping community as my full-time job.

You can sponsor me through [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/quincylvania) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/waysidemapping). There are no fees on these sites.

**_Thank you for your support!!_**
